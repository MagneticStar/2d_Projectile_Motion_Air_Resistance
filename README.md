# 2d_Projectile_Motion_Air_Resistance
A python script calculates the trajectory of a sphere under air resistance

This script pulls data from an excel doc and calculates the initial conditions of velocity and position in the x and y directions. It then intergrates these inputs with solve_ivp to plot the trajectory of the sphere

The original code was taken from https://scipython.com/book2/chapter-8-scipy/examples/a-projectile-with-air-resistance/
